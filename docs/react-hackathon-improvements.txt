Known issues & improvements
=================
1. Changing item's title field in item type doesn't reflect the changes in existing inventories (issue)
2. Validation in all fields has been left undone due to insufficient time (improvement)
3. Validation on duplicate fields while adding into item type (improvement)
4. We could add other attributes of each field type defined i.e. (date field may contains dateformat, number field may contain allow decimal or not, future date etc.) (improvement)
